//what is the class component - its a normal js class at the end of day
// To make Userclass a component we write extends React.component
// extends React.component will tell parcel that this is a class based component
// React.component is a class which is given by react and Userclass is inheriting some properties from it

// This line defines a new class component called UserClass.

// extends React.Component - This means that UserClass inherits from the React.Component class.
  
// It gives the UserClass access to methods and properties that React components use, like render() and state.

class UserClass extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {

    // The constructor method is automatically called when a new instance of a class is created.

    super(props); // Calling the parent constructor

    // The super keyword in JavaScript is used to call the constructor or methods of a parent class. It acts as a bridge between the child and parent classes.

    // In JavaScript, a class that extends another class (like React.Component) must call super() before using this.
    // This ensures that the parent class is properly initialized.

    // When you create a class that extends another class, the subclass inherits all the methods and properties of the parent class.
    // To properly inherit and initialize the parent class, you must call the parent constructor.

    // When super(props) is called:

    //1. It triggers the parent class constructor (React.Component).

    //2. The parent constructor initializes the component.

    //3. this.props becomes accessible within the derived class.

    // Skipping super() will lead to a ReferenceError.

    // when i am rendering a function component on page it means i am mounting or invoking the function 
    // when you are loading a class based component that means i am creating an instance of a class 
    // whenver you create an instance of a class constuctor would get called and this would be best place to receive props and create state variables
